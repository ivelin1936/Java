Herb Garden Solution - Console Application

 - Read input plants from the console (input example "2, 7, 5, 3")
	- split by pattern (", ")
	- map every element to integer
	- return an array containing the elements of this stream
	
 - On second row reading an integer representing the number of days over which we're trying to maximize 
	the number of total leaves we can collect. This is also equal to the number of times we will harvest 
	a plant, since we harvest one each day.
	
 - Create method herbGarden(int[] plants, int numberOfDays); which return an integer representing the 
	maximum total number of leaves you can harvest in the given number of days.
	- Initialize an integer variable (int totalHarvestedLeaves = 0;), which will hold the total harvested leaves.
		It's primitive type, so by default will be equal to 0, but to be clear we will initialize it equal to zero.
	- With for loop we will go through every day 
		1. incrementing totalHarvestedLeaves variable with return value of harvest(plants) method.
		2. Every night, each of the plants grows 2 new leaves using growsPlants(plants); method.
	- Return totalHarvestedLeaves
	
 - Create method findBiggestPlantIndex(int[] plants), which accept as parrameters an integer array of all plants
	and find and return index of the biggest plant; This is also equal to the index of the biggest plant, which we will harvest,
	because for maximum total number of leaves we can harvest in the given number of days, we need to harvest every day 
	the biggest plant for optimal solution.
	- Initialize an integer variable (int biggestPlantIndex = 0;), which will hold the index of the biggest plant.
	- Using for loop, which starting from "int currentPlantIndex = 1", iterate till currentPlantIndex is smaller 
	  than plants array length, with step equal to 1; For every plant we make a check if the plant's leaves on the current index
	  are more than plant's leaves on the biggestPlantIndex. If this condition is true - biggestPlantIndex = currentPlantIndex;
	- Return biggestPlantIndex;
	
 - Create method harvest(int[] plants) 
	- Find index of the biggest plant with using findBiggestPlantIndex(plants) method
	- Harvest half of it's leaves (rounded down) and keep the result into harvestedLeaves variable.
	- Reduce the plant's leaves of this position by harvestedLeaves
	- Return harvested leaves.
 
 - Create method growsPlants(int[] plants) 
	- Using for loop, which iterate over the plants and incrementing every plant's leaves with 2
	
 - Print result of herbGarden(plants, days) - an integer representing the maximum total number of leaves
	you can harvest in the given number of days.
